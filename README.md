# generals

Notes for my generals (passed on May 10, 2022), although they could have been more complete if I began to prepare a bit earlier.

I had Gaspar for Stars, Eve for ISM, Jeremy for Dynamics, and Peter for Cosmology. The Dynamics notes are just an annotated version of Jeremy's outline.

The format looks better if you open them with [Typora](https://typora.io/).
