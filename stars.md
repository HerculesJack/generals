### Stellar Evolution

**Hayashi track**: fully convective, the right side is forbidden because the temperature gradient would be too large compared with the adiabatic gradient, and the large luminosity will restructure the star and bring it back to the Hayashi track. The left side has a smaller temperature gradient, and is partly radiative.

**Convection regions**: convective envelope for low mass stars, because low temperature -> high opacity. Convective core for high mass stars, because CNO burning produces too large luminosity. Boundaries: roughly 0.4 and 1.2.

**MS**: core H burning

**RGB**: inert He core, shell H burning

**HB**: core He burning, shell H burning

**AGB**: inert C core, shell He and H burning

**~0.1M$_{\odot}$**: fully convective, just burn all H to He and become WD

**<0.6M$_{\odot}$**: become RG but do not reach the tip and become WD

**Helium flush**: only for 0.6-2.0 $M_{\odot}$ with degenerate He core burning (red clump)
